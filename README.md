## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development
- Use of subselectors such as  ***.class > div{}*** 
- use of class related attributes such as disable, checked.
- container sizing (its always a struggle)


### Useful resources

- [SVG color](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/fill/) - This helped me to color an SVG.
- [Position property CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - official Documentation explaining how each value of the position property works, this helped me understand the importance of using "position: relative" instead of an static one to create a size adapting tooltip.
